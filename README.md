# KitchenRoller
Platformer made in Adobe Animate (ActionScript3).

This is a sidescrolling platformer. Its a coin rolling across tables in a kitchen, ground breaking right? You avoid obstacles by pressing Space to jump over them.
To roll under a pillar, press the left arrow to turn into a penny for 2 seconds, you can extend the time by pressing left arrow again while still a penny.
There are powerups you can jump up and grab. Double points, Slow time, and a small coin. Double points is self explanitory. Slow time gives you a slow-mo effect, which at least to me makes it harder, so try to avoid them.
The coins charge up your "Quarter Power", which is display by the bar at the top left corner of the screen. Once you've picked up 4 coins, you can press right arrow to become a quarter, becoming invulnerable to all obstacles and destroying them on the touch.
There is no end, just a score for how well you played.

Made in Adobe Animate to practice coding game engines. This game implements self made game loop/update functions, delta time, SceneGraph, Game Scenes, Player States, euler physics, AABB collision detection, AABB-Radial collision detection, GameObject base class, and onCollision functions.

Not to many imperfections with this game. Only problem after playing it is that sometimes a powerup will spawn right above an obstacle, so its nearly impossible to pick it up without dying. Might fix if necessary.
